# Scala Functional Programming Principles (Martin Odersky, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne)

Get up and running with Scala on your computer. Complete an example assignment to familiarize yourself with our unique 
way of submitting assignments. In this week, we'll learn the difference between functional imperative programming. 
We step through the basics of Scala; covering expressions, evaluation, conditionals, functions, and recursion.
